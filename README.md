# Kale: Your UCLA Sustainability and Health companion.

 Submission for Hack on the Hill X by ACM at UCLA. 

Kale is a mobile app that recommends daily food options on the UCLA campus according to the studentâ€™s personal health and sustainability preferences. The app builds a smart UCLA-curated diet model that makes meal choosing speedy and hassle-free using an AI-powered algorithm. Users can select their food preferences and get personalized recommendations.

This app is built on Figma, Flutter, PHP, and MySQL server

# How to run the application

*The 'kale' folder in the repository contains all the frontend code in Flutter including screens, widgets etc.* In order to run the app, open the folder under Android Studio or VS Code and click run.

*The 'hoth_backend' folder in the repository contains all the backend code too, which we have hosted on a GoDaddy Server for your convenience.* This backend consists of our web scraper, meal recommendation AI, and all APIs that we wrote for the app. In order to run the backend locally, upload the hoth_backend folder to the public_html or htdocs folder of an Apache server where Python is installed
